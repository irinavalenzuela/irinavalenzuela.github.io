### [Do Unannounced Visits to Schools Affect Student Performance? Evidence from a Large-scale Monitoring Program in Peru](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1P2Z99_xIK192Ud7Jm2FR-p9BXFtdEl4U){target="_blank"} (Job Market Paper)

Findings from prior studies of the effects of low-stakes monitoring (monitoring unaccompanied by explicit incentives or punishments) on student achievement in developing countries are mixed. Because most of these initiatives were carried out on a small scale by non-governmental organizations, these findings may lack validity in the case of large-scale government interventions. I investigate the educational impact of the Semaforo Escuela program. This is a large-scale monitoring system in Peru that implements unannounced monthly school inspections, the results of which are reported to local education officials. To analyze the causal effect of these monitoring visits, I use the random variation in the selection of visited schools in the program’s first year to estimate causal effects of low-stakes monitoring on student math and reading scores. Although I fail to find evidence that a monitoring visit enhances school-level student performance on average, there is a positive effect of monitoring on reading test scores at low-performing urban schools and when urban schools are visited in the months preceding the exam date. 

### Effects of Political Corruption on Political Attitudes: Evidence from theOdebrecht Scandal in Peru

Does political corruption erode people’s attitudes towards political institutions and democracy? I test this hypothesis in the context of Peru by exploiting a corruption shock, the Odebrecht case, which revealed the corruption of high-ranked politicians in the tenders for large infrastructure projects. I draw on household survey data collected during the unanticipated Odebrecht scandal, which allows me to adopt a quasi-experimental approach. I find that, following revelations of corruption by governmental officials, people’s confidence in different political institutions and democracy does not vary significantly. These findings are in line with no change in perceived corruption as one of the main problems of the country after the scandal.
