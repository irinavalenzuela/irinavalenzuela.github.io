Because most of\r\nthese initiatives were carried out on a small scale by non-governmental\r\norganizations, these findings may lack validity in the case of\r\nlarge-scale government interventions. I investigate the educational\r\nimpact of the Semaforo Escuela program. This is a large-scale monitoring\r\nsystem in Peru that implements unannounced monthly school inspections,\r\nthe results of which are reported to local education officials. To\r\nanalyze the causal effect of these monitoring visits, I use the random\r\nvariation in the selection of visited schools in the program’s first\r\nyear to estimate causal effects of low-stakes monitoring on student math\r\nand reading scores. Although I fail to find evidence that a monitoring\r\nvisit enhances school-level student performance on average, there is a\r\npositive effect of monitoring on reading test scores at low-performing\r\nurban schools and when urban schools are visited in the months preceding\r\nthe exam date.\r\nGirls\r\nOutperforming Boys: Pre-school Gender Gap in Literacy and Numeracy\r\nSkills in African Countries (With Julie Buhl-Wiggers, Rebecca Thornton,\r\nand Mahounan Yedomiffi)\r\nLittle is known about whether there exists a gender gap in pre-school\r\nmeasures of early numeracy and literacy skills, and what predictors – if\r\nany – help to understand any difference across gender. We use two rounds\r\nof available Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and Multiple Indicator\r\nCluster Survey (MICS), collected from 2011 to 2019 across 25 African\r\ncountries, and compare mothers’ reports of numbers and letters\r\nidentification among boys and girls ages 3–4. We report that, on\r\naverage, girls are 2 percentage points more likely to identify at least\r\nten letters of the alphabet, 1 percentage point more likely to read four\r\nwords, and 2 percentage points more likely to identify the first ten\r\nnumbers. These magnitudes are small in absolute terms but relevant given\r\nthe low rates of these competences in African countries (on average 20\r\npercent). We find that part of this gender gap is due to girls accessing\r\nearly childhood education programs. In addition, we report that both\r\nmother’s and father’s literacy show a positive intergenerational effect\r\non their children’s outcomes. The mother’s literacy has a greater\r\nmagnitude than the father’s and is more relevant for their daughter’s\r\ncompetencies.\r\nWork in Progress\r\nEffects\r\nof Political Corruption on Political Attitudes: Evidence from\r\ntheOdebrecht Scandal in Peru\r\nDoes political corruption erode people’s attitudes towards political\r\ninstitutions and democracy? I test this hypothesis in the context of\r\nPeru by exploiting a corruption shock, the Odebrecht case, which\r\nrevealed the corruption of high-ranked politicians in the tenders for\r\nlarge infrastructure projects. I draw on household survey data collected\r\nduring the unanticipated Odebrecht scandal, which allows me to adopt a\r\nquasi-experimental approach. I find that, following revelations of\r\ncorruption by governmental officials, people’s confidence in different\r\npolitical institutions and democracy does not vary significantly. These\r\nfindings are in line with no change in perceived corruption as one of\r\nthe main problems of the country after the scandal.\r\nPublications\r\nAssets and Economic Context – Factors related to poverty\r\nin Peru (in Spanish, translated tittle)\r\nCentral Reserve Bank of Peru.
