Evidence from a Large-scale Monitoring Program in Peru\r\n(Job Market Paper)\r\nFindings from prior studies of the effects of low-stakes monitoring\r\n(monitoring unaccompanied by explicit incentives or punishments) on\r\nstudent achievement in developing countries are mixed. Because most of\r\nthese initiatives were carried out on a small scale by non-governmental\r\norganizations, these findings may lack validity in the case of\r\nlarge-scale government interventions. I investigate the educational\r\nimpact of the Semaforo Escuela program. This is a large-scale monitoring\r\nsystem in Peru that implements unannounced monthly school inspections,\r\nthe results of which are reported to local education officials. To\r\nanalyze the causal effect of these monitoring visits, I use the random\r\nvariation in the selection of visited schools in the program’s first\r\nyear to estimate causal effects of low-stakes monitoring on student math\r\nand reading scores. Although I fail to find evidence that a monitoring\r\nvisit enhances school-level student performance on average, there is a\r\npositive effect of monitoring on reading test scores at low-performing\r\nurban schools and when urban schools are visited in the months preceding\r\nthe exam date.\r\nEffects\r\nof Political Corruption on Political Attitudes: Evidence from\r\ntheOdebrecht Scandal in Peru\r\nDoes political corruption erode people’s attitudes towards political\r\ninstitutions and democracy? I test this hypothesis in the context of\r\nPeru by exploiting a corruption shock, the Odebrecht case, which\r\nrevealed the corruption of high-ranked politicians in the tenders for\r\nlarge infrastructure projects. I draw on household survey data collected\r\nduring the unanticipated Odebrecht scandal, which allows me to adopt a\r\nquasi-experimental approach. I find that, following revelations of\r\ncorruption by governmental officials, people’s confidence in different\r\npolitical institutions and democracy does not vary significantly. These\r\nfindings are in line with no change in perceived corruption as one of\r\nthe main problems of the country after the scandal.\r\nPublications\r\nDepth of outreach in the context of microfinance\r\ncommercialization in Peru (in Spanish, translated tittle)\r\nRevista Economía.
